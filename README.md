# Loan Calculator

Android app with the goal of being able to calculate, study, and export any kind of loan.

> This is a holding place for a yet unreleased project. See its predecessor [Loan Analyzer}(https://github.com/louisbloom/loananalyzer) which is in maintainance mode.

This project is a rewrite of "Loan Analyzer". Some of the design goals are:

- Use of BigDecimal.
- More flexible loan design.
- Use of graphs.
- Sharing supports.
